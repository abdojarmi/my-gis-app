I will be working toward my vision to be independent, build my own home, and live with my daughter.” This woman is now the leader of the Takhrkhourt agricultural Cooperative.\n\n“My name is L. I dropped out of middle school during the last school break. I started training in artisanal craft, but I don’t feel comfortable with the decision that I made, and I don’t know how I can tell my father.” On the second day of the workshop, she told the other women participants: “I informed my father about how I felt, and he agrees with my decision to return to school.”\n\nOne of the results that came from the empowerment workshop and the participatory approach meetings that were conducted afterward with the same women was the vision to create an agricultural cooperative in order to capitalize upon the village’s great natural resources. To reach this vision, the women needed technical and managerial training. This is why the High Atlas Foundation (HAF) provided them with training on the creation and role of cooperative statutes, democratic voting for decision-making in the cooperative, organizational management, environmental protection, how to plant seeds and cuttings of trees, and how to irrigate trees.\n\nThroughout each training and workshop that the women received in 2019-2020, HAF supported them to create Cooperative Takhrkhourt, an agricultural cooperative whose membership includes one woman and four girls. Two of the girls are studying in high school, and they want to continue their studies at university. In 2020 alone, Cooperative Takhrkhourt planted 40,000 olive and walnut trees in a nursery that they manage. The nursery is supported by the Ecosia-HAF partnership.\nThe women’s cooperative now wants to expand the project. They are thinking about beekeeping and growing medicinal plants in the future.\n\nTo achieve these results means that the women of Takhrkhourt Cooperative have:\n\nMade decisions about their own lives, as demonstrated by starting the cooperative that they themselves chose and created;\nLearned how to manage their time between studies, work at the nursery, and work at home;\nMade initial visits to the bank, local authorities, ODCO (Office du Développement de Coopération), and met other people outside of the village to promote their initiative;\nOpened a bank account, possibly for the first time in their lives, in order to receive income and manage cooperative finances;\nStarted to receive income;\nBegun to experience and enjoy independence and autonomy;\nVoted for administrative members; and\nCreated space for communication between them and other visitors to learn about the project.", "Economic Impact": "Created a cooperative and managment of the cooperative", "Latitude DD": 31.16507, "Longitude DD": -8.029568, "Social Media Post": "No social Media Post", "Link of Photos in Flicker": "Link", "Email address": "amina@highatlasfoundation.org", "Flip chart": "-", "Report": "-", "field_39": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -8.029568, 31.16507 ] } },
