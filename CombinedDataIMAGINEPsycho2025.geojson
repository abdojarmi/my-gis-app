I will be working toward my vision to be independent, build my own home, and live with my daughter.” This woman is now the leader of the Takhrkhourt agricultural Cooperative.\n\n“My name is L. I dropped out of middle school during the last school break. I started training in artisanal craft, but I don’t feel comfortable with the decision that I made, and I don’t know how I can tell my father.” On the second day of the workshop, she told the other women participants: “I informed my father about how I felt, and he agrees with my decision to return to school.”\n\nOne of the results that came from the empowerment workshop and the participatory approach meetings that were conducted afterward with the same women was the vision to create an agricultural cooperative in order to capitalize upon the village’s great natural resources. To reach this vision, the women needed technical and managerial training. This is why the High Atlas Foundation (HAF) provided them with training on the creation and role of cooperative statutes, democratic voting for decision-making in the cooperative, organizational management, environmental protection, how to plant seeds and cuttings of trees, and how to irrigate trees.\n\nThroughout each training and workshop that the women received in 2019-2020, HAF supported them to create Cooperative Takhrkhourt, an agricultural cooperative whose membership includes one woman and four girls. Two of the girls are studying in high school, and they want to continue their studies at university. In 2020 alone, Cooperative Takhrkhourt planted 40,000 olive and walnut trees in a nursery that they manage. The nursery is supported by the Ecosia-HAF partnership.\nThe women’s cooperative now wants to expand the project. They are thinking about beekeeping and growing medicinal plants in the future.\n\nTo achieve these results means that the women of Takhrkhourt Cooperative have:\n\nMade decisions about their own lives, as demonstrated by starting the cooperative that they themselves chose and created;\nLearned how to manage their time between studies, work at the nursery, and work at home;\nMade initial visits to the bank, local authorities, ODCO (Office du Développement de Coopération), and met other people outside of the village to promote their initiative;\nOpened a bank account, possibly for the first time in their lives, in order to receive income and manage cooperative finances;\nStarted to receive income;\nBegun to experience and enjoy independence and autonomy;\nVoted for administrative members; and\nCreated space for communication between them and other visitors to learn about the project.","Economic_Impact":"Created a cooperative and managment of the

dealing with the established goals.”\n- “I learned from the opinions of others and the social issues that have been addressed, and discussed the proposed solutions to those social problems, in addition to the role of civil society in this regard.”\n- “I benefited from the self-empowerment workshop because it gave me a set of information, including how to work on the methods of decision-making and communication, discovering other experiences, and more information. This also includes discussions that affect my personality. I hope to God Almighty that such courses will continue because they are beneficial to the human personality for self\uFFFEdevelopment”.\n- \"Exchanging experiences and ideas gave me positive energies with constructive discussion\".\n- “The atmosphere of the workshop was family, in which everyone was able to acquire knowledge, develop oneself and benefit from the experience of Ms. Amina. We also benefited from teaching the art of making life the way we want with commitment and discipline”;\n- “We thank you for such programs and topics that benefit the students. They deserve encouragement.”\n- “I learned how to be confident in my goals with determination and will, and how to express my opinion without feeling embarrassed.”\n- “The things that have impressed me are the dialogue format and the mutual experiences from which we benefited a lot, and we also gained a set of basics for self-empowerment through the ambitions we seek to reach in the future”.\n- \"I learned from the self-empowerment workshop that the issue of civil society has an important role in achieving personality through openness, developing my personality and skills through student participation.”\n- \"I learned from the self-empowerment workshop how to develop my personal capabilities, self-esteem, and prioritization, thank you all\"\n- “The thing that I liked about the self-empowerment workshop is that it raises topics that concern the individual personality of the person. I benefited primarily from the principle of managing the growth edge limit according to four important steps in order to reach the presented goal, and then provide the courage to reach the special vision and strengthen self-confidence”\n- “I learned from many things, including the increase of new ideas, personal power sources, and openness to various experiences in several disciplines.”\n- \"In all honesty, I benefited a lot from the workshop that Ms. Amina supervised. I want to comment on the most important thing in this experience, which is the method of the professor's handling and dedication to communicating information. The problem is not in the information, but in the way of delivery and interaction; I felt as if I was in a family atmosphere. I thank the High Atlas Foundation and The Great Atlas for this opportunity and for the work team that was with the professor. We are grateful and we apologize if we had any shortcomings or deviations from the topics.”","Economic_Impact":"No
